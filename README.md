Online Retail Store Analysis Project

### üîç Business Problem:
Online retailers accumulate large volumes of data but often struggle to extract actionable insights that improve customer experience, optimize product offerings, and increase revenue.

This project aims to solve key business challenges such as:
* Understanding customer purchasing behavior
* Identifying high-performing products and revenue drivers
* Detecting patterns in price sensitivity
* Segmenting customers for targeted marketing
* Optimizing digital engagement strategies via traffic insights

### üéØ Project Objectives:
* Segment customers based on age, gender, total spend, and discounts applied.
* Analyze product pricing and sales patterns to understand revenue contribution and price sensitivity.
* Identify high-converting products and monthly/seasonal sales trends.
* Uncover geographical trends in product sales by membership types (Gold, Silver, Bronze).
* Evaluate website traffic and customer engagement by traffic source and sentiment.
* Present all findings interactively using a Power BI dashboard for stakeholders.

### üß† Business Questions Explored
1) What is the relationship between age, gender, and purchasing behavior?
2) Are there significant differences in average monthly revenue between top-selling products?
3) Which products show seasonal performance variations?
4) How does price affect sales volume (price sensitivity)?
5) What is the regional distribution of product sales by membership type?
6) How do traffic sources influence customer engagement and conversion?

### Conclusion
In this project, I combined Python for deep-dive exploratory analysis and Power BI for dynamic stakeholder reporting. My goal was to help an online retail company understand not just who their top customers are, but why they purchase, what they buy, when they buy, and how traffic sources influence their behavior.
This helped in shaping data-driven strategies for pricing, inventory planning, regional marketing, and personalized communication.
